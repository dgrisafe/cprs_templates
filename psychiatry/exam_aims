# Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)
 
Comment: _____
 
  Score the highest amplitude or frequency in a movement on the 0-4 scale,
  not the average;
  Score Activated Movements the same way; do not lower those numbers as was
  proposed at one time;
  A POSITIVE AIMS EXAMINATION IS A SCORE OF 2 IN TWO OR MORE MOVEMENTS or a
  SCORE OF 3 OR 4 IN A SINGLE MOVEMENT
  Do not sum the scores: e.g., a patient who has scores 1 in four movements
  DOES NOT have a positive AIMS score of 4.
 
  Scoring Options:
   - 0 None, Normal
   - 1 Minimal (may be extreme normal)
   - 2 Mild
   - 3 Moderate
   - 4 Severe

H. Severity of abnormal movements
 
 
I. Incapacitation due to abnormal

   Awareness; 1 Aware, No Distress; 2 Aware, Mild Distress; 3 Aware, Moderate
   Distress; 4 Aware, Severe Distress)
